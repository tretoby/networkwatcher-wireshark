**Network Packet Capture in Azure with Network Watcher and Wireshark**

Objective

This project demonstrates the implementation of network packet capture and analysis using Azure Network Watcher and Wireshark. The goal is to showcase the ability to:
Configure and utilize Azure Network Watcher for capturing traffic in an Azure Virtual Network.
Analyze network traffic using Wireshark to identify patterns, potential vulnerabilities, and anomalies.
Gain hands-on experience in networking, cloud infrastructure, and security monitoring.

Skills Learned

Azure Cloud Infrastructure Management: Setting up Virtual Machines and Virtual Networks.
Network Monitoring: Capturing traffic using Azure Network Watcherâ€™s packet capture feature.
Packet Analysis: Using Wireshark to inspect TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, and other protocol packets.
Security Awareness: Identifying unusual network traffic and understanding basic network attack patterns.


Steps:
create a windows virtual machine

connect to to virtual machine then navigate to server manager (select add roles)

install web server (IIS)

create a blob storage account

In Azure navigate to network watcher and select packet capture

add resource group, and storage account, then set the time limit to 300 seconds

navigate to target VM and select extentions to see the networkwatcher extention added to the virtual machine

navigate back to network watcher packet capture. The status should say loading while it is capturing the packets

now open up the web page by using the public ip of virtual machine to drive traffic to the server

stop packet capture

navigate to the storage created previously, and select storage browser, blob containers, network watcher logs

download packet capture log
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a48309b-5653-4434-8c8e-a61b56a961e8)

open wireshark and add downloaded file
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0543a81d-4104-4a78-819b-733ee6014b61)

now you can see the contents of the capture file

filter using the port 80 that was previously used to connect to the virtual machine. filter = (ip.addr eq **** and tcp.port eq 80)
