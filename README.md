**Network Packet Capture in Azure with Network Watcher and Wireshark**

Objective

This project demonstrates the implementation of network packet capture and analysis using Azure Network Watcher and Wireshark. The goal is to showcase the ability to:
Configure and utilize Azure Network Watcher for capturing traffic in an Azure Virtual Network.
Analyze network traffic using Wireshark to identify patterns, potential vulnerabilities, and anomalies.
Gain hands-on experience in networking, cloud infrastructure, and security monitoring.

Skills Learned

Azure Cloud Infrastructure Management: Setting up Virtual Machines and Virtual Networks.
Network Monitoring: Capturing traffic using Azure Network Watcherâ€™s packet capture feature.
Packet Analysis: Using Wireshark to inspect TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, and other protocol packets.
Security Awareness: Identifying unusual network traffic and understanding basic network attack patterns.
